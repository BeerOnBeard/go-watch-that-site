# Go Watch That Site

Time to experiment with Golang! I'm waiting on deals to buy a new mountain bike and I want a simple program to scrape a site then compare it to the last scrape. If there's a change, I want to know about it.

## Usage

The flags `emailTo`, `emailFrom`, and `emailPassword` must all be provided in order to run the application.

```bash
./go-watch-that-site -emailTo=destination@email.test -emailFrom=from@email.test -emailPassword=someComplicatedH@x0rPW
```
